        <h2>Nature within Seattle</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Green Lake</li>
          <p>This park is one of Seattle's most popular, so expect it to be full of people exercising or picnicing no matter when you go. The park has several adorable docks (while the light is best during golden hour, that's also when fish bite, so
            don't expect to have it to yourelf). In August and October there are lantern festivals, and on the west side of the park there's the Woodland Park Zoo.</p>

          <li>University of Washington Wetlands</li>
          <p>This hidden park has several miles of paths between trees and through fields. There's a cute bridge on the west side (head towards the UW stadium and you can't miss it!) as well as a couple of cute benches. This is a wildlife preserve,
            so stay on the path, and give the creatures room! I've seen all kinds of birds, plus ducks and river otters.
            In the summer, it's a beautiful green, but in the autumn the leaves change to stunning colors and in the winter the park is full of lovely muted neutrals.
            I recommend wearing flats or wedges (maybe even boots) because the paths do flood and get muddy after Washington's rainstorms!

          <li>University of Washington Arboretum</li>
          <p>The Arboretum is probably best known for the 3.5 acre traditional Japanese garden, which is particularly beautiful in the autumn. Admission is $8 for adults and hours depend on the month, but the most important thing to remember is that
            they have strict <a href="https://www.seattlejapanesegarden.org/location-and-hours">rules</a> regarding photography equipment, portrait shoots, and outfit changes. Elsewhere, admission is free, and the park is full of joggers on the
            pedestrian trails and cyclists on the roads! The park is full of quaint bridges and a multitude of trees, bushes, and flowers. </p>

          <li>Discovery Park</li>
          <p>If you park at the south entrance, plan on a minimum 20-30 minute walk to the lighthouse. More likely than not, you'll want to stop and take photos in the beautiful fields along the way, and maybe again when the trail cuts through a
            small forest, sometimes with beautiful wooden fences! If you come at high tide, the waves will come all the way up to the driftwood and there won't really be any sand. On clear days, you can see both the Olympics and Mt. Rainier from the
            beach.</p>

          <li>Ravenna Park</li>
          <p>This is less of a "park" and more of a forest. When you drive by the park, the trees look as tall as a one or two story building, but the trees are growing out of what I would call a ravine: if you go down into the park, there's a creek
            and running trails. There are several bridges that cross over the park, and there's a couple of cute tiny fields on the north edge of the park. </p>

          <li>Magnuson Park</li>
          <p>The southern edge of the park is the most photogenic: empty fields and a few marshy ponds which would be great for solo portraits. If you walk all the way to the east edge of the park, you have a great view of Kirkland across the water,
            as well as a few boat docks, cute stairs, lifeguard stands, and the recycled "Fin Art" sculpture. The west and northern parts of the park are less photogenic for traditional portraits: a rock climbing gym, sports fields, and a community
            center.</p>

          <p>This park is likely best known for the former Seattle Gas Light Company gasification plant and the view of the stunning Seattle skyline. But the Burke-Gilman trail also runs behind this park, providing ample opportunities for nature-y
            shots.

          <p>There are three main signs: "Public Market Center" with the clock at 1st and Pike St (hard to time with delivery trucks and pedestrians),
            "Pike Place Market" at Pike St and Virginia St (less crowded, but you still need to watch out for traffic), and
            "Public Market" with the fish at Pike St and Pine St (generally the best location if you're doing more than one pose).
            Of course, you can also walk over down to the gum wall underneath the main PMC sign,
            or down to the waterfront to get shots with the skyline, Cascade Mountains, ferries, and ferris wheel in the background. </p>

          <li>Goddard Mini Park</li>
          <p>This is the teeniest park that I've ever held a session at (about the size of two or three houses),
            but it's a beautiful and quiet place. It's a great backup plan to the downtown city park in Bellevue, which was packed everytime I walked by in 2020 during the pandemic. The rhododendrons bloom in May, and the evergreen trees look nice
            year round!
            There are benches and picnic tables as well.

            enjoy picnic space, seasonal flowers, and a teensy creek.</p>
