            <h2>Style guide</h2>
            <p>For family and individual portrait sessions</p>
          </div>
        </header>
        <p>The clothes you choose to wear can really make or break your portrait session! Most importantly, pick clothes that you feel comfortable and confident in. Here are some tips on how to pick clothes that will make you look good, too!
        </P>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Choose a color scheme</b></li>
          <p>I recommend choosing three or four colors that are all in the same set of tones (earth tones, dark jewel tones, shades of blue, pastels, neutrals, etc)
            and then having everyone in your group pick outfits that are within this scheme. You don't need to match perfectly, you need to cordinate!
            Try searching online for "family wardrobe color palette 2020" if you need some ideas to get you going.
          </p>

          <li><b>Wear solid colored clothing</b></li>
          <p>Busy prints can be distracting and make it hard to pick matching outfits for the rest of your family,
            so make sure no more than one person is wearing patterns!
            Avoid clothing with words, logos, or characters, unless you're bringing a school sweatshirt to your graduation photoshoot.
            When people look at the photos, they will be trying to read the writing instead of actually looking at your photos.
            Instead of patterns, try experiementing with textures!</p>

          <!-- <li>Sleeves</b></li>
            <p>I recommend tops with sleeves because your arms can draw attention away from your face.</p> -->

          <li><b>Shoes</b></li>
          <p>Wear something you're comfortable in: avoid new shoes that might give you blisters because you'll likely be doing a bit of walking between backgrounds!
            Make sure the shoes match the setting: if your portrait session is at the beach, stilettos might look out of place.
            Gentlemen, your socks should match your pants, and consider polishing your shoes.
            Parents, do a shoe check before you get in your car--- it's no fun to get to the site and then realize your toddler is wearing rainboots with their suit!
          </p>

          <li><b>Bring accessories!</b></li>
          <p>Bring a hat, vest, scarf, or sweater! These are easy to take on and off, and will give your photos more variety. Jewellery is nice too, but remember to keep it simple so the attention is on you, instead of what you're wearing.</p>

          <li><b>Glasses</b></li>
          <p>I recommend taking your glasses or sunglasses off 15-20 minutes before your session so their is time for the marks on your nose have time to disappear. If you plan on wearing them, I'll work with you to minimize reflection and glare!</p>

          <li><b>Hairstyling and nails</b></li>
          <p>If you're going to get your haircut, do it at least two weeks before your session so you're more used to it!
            Think about your outfit before you pick a hairstyle:
            if you're wearing an evening gown, try a fancy up-do. But if you're wearing a tshirt and jeans, a pony tail would be perfect.
            If it's windy or you are prone to fly-away hair, bobby pins or hair ties might be helpful to bring in case you decide to put your hair up.
            Make sure that your nails look well-trimmed and clean. If you're going to paint them, make sure the color doesn't clash with your outfits,
            and remember that if you're wearing sandals we can see what color your toe nails are too!
          </p>

          <li><b>Props</b></li>
          <p>If you're doing <u>maternity photos</u>, I recommend bringing one or two ultrasounds. Trim the edges (and decide if you want to cut off your name and birthdate from the image).
            You can also consider bringing one or two pieces of baby clothes (a pair of shoes, a white onesie, a dress) or a toy (stuffed bear, wooden train) or wooden blocks that spell out "girl", "boy", or your baby's name.
          </p>

            </section> -->

          <p>
            For <u>family photos</u>, I recommend bringing a blanket for everyone to sit on for some of the pictures.
            I recommend bringing a toy or snack for your smaller kids--- if a meltdown starts approaching, we can get some couple pictures of mom and dad while your kids take a short break, plus I can capture some pictures of them with their favorite
            toy!
            For babies, I recommend bringing a toy that I can hold up above my camera to rattle, squeek, or shake to try and get their attention.
          </p>

            </div>
            </section>-->
          <p>
            For <u>graduates</u>, don't forget your cap, gown, tassel, any cords or stoles that you earned, and your class ring! I recommend ironing your gown before the shoot ;)
            Everything else is optional. Some people want to pop the bubbly in their session, blow confetti at the camera, bring a pet, balloons, or textbooks.
            Feel free to bring props related to what you studied or the clubs you were in: we can take photos in your cheerleading outfit, basketball jersey, or with the instrument you played in marching band!
            If you're in medical school, consider wearing scrubs for one of your outfits, or bring a stethescope to wear around your neck.
